Q-4. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper
at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)?

Ans:

To find the probability of drawing a slip with a perfect square number, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (slips with perfect square numbers) and the total number of possible outcomes (total number of slips).

Favorable outcomes:
There are four perfect square numbers between 1 and 20: 1, 4, 9, and 16. These are the numbers that we consider as favorable outcomes.

Total number of possible outcomes:
Since each friend writes a number between 1 and 20, the total number of slips is equal to the total number of friends, which is 20. These are all the possible outcomes.

Probability:
The probability of an event is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes.

Probability of drawing a slip with a perfect square number = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

Number of favorable outcomes = 4 (as there are four perfect square numbers)
Total number of possible outcomes = 20 (as there are 20 friends)

Probability = 4/20 = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square is 0.2 or 20%.

In simpler terms, there is a 20% chance that when a slip is drawn at random, the number on it will be a perfect square (1, 4, 9, or 16).
