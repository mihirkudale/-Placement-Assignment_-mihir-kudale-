Q-5. A certain city has two taxi companies: Company A has 80% of the taxis and
Company B has 20% of the taxis. Company A's taxis have a 95% success rate for picking
up passengers on time, while Company B's taxis have a 90% success rate. If a randomly
selected taxi is late, what is the probability that it belongs to Company A?

Ans: we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a late taxi belongs to Company A given the provided information.

Let's define the events as follows:
A: The taxi belongs to Company A.
B: The taxi belongs to Company B.
L: The taxi is late.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.8 (Company A has 80% of the taxis)
P(B) = 0.2 (Company B has 20% of the taxis)
P(L|A) = 0.05 (Company A's taxis have a 95% success rate)
P(L|B) = 0.10 (Company B's taxis have a 90% success rate)

We need to find P(A|L), the probability that a late taxi belongs to Company A.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|L) = (P(L|A) * P(A)) / P(L)

To calculate P(L), we can use the law of total probability:
P(L) = P(L|A) * P(A) + P(L|B) * P(B)

Let's calculate P(L) first:
P(L) = (0.05 * 0.8) + (0.10 * 0.2)
= 0.04 + 0.02
= 0.06

Now, we can calculate P(A|L):
P(A|L) = (P(L|A) * P(A)) / P(L)
= (0.05 * 0.8) / 0.06
= 0.04 / 0.06
â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that a late taxi belongs to Company A is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%.
