Karnataka should also focus in North and central karnataka for balance regional development and reduce burden on bengaluru
"Bengaluru is NOT overrated, it's little over crowded because it accept each and every type of employees and workers with open arm and gives us Food, Water, Shelter Thank you Bengaluru ️"
Thank you for this wonderful video! I have incurred so much losses trading on my own....I trade well on demo but I think the real market is manipulated.... Can anyone help me out or at least tell me what I'm doing wrong?
"You forgot The Father of an Indian Engineer ""Sir M. Visvesvaraya KCIE/Kingdom of Mysore"" Visvesvaraya is regarded in India as one of the foremost civil engineers whose birthday, 15 September, is celebrated every year as an Engineer Day in India, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.

Throughout his career, Sir M. Visvesvaraya played a vital role in the development of various engineering projects in India. He was involved in the design and construction of numerous dams, bridges, and water supply systems. His most notable contributions include the design and construction of the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam in Mysore, England, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and the flood protection system for the city of Hyderabad."
"India needs 20 cities like Bengaluru. 
There are hardly any mega cities in whole north india apart from delhi to support 600Million people."
Bangalore is a city that pulls out people like us from all across India to upskill ourself and be the tech savy and literate population our government want us to be. After 3 years here in Bangalore it feels more like home to me than my actual home is and the way this city has transformed me is unimaginable and unthinkable in every aspect. Thanks Bangalore for accepting me with open arms 
"I think you have to make a case study on Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar ,because his vision changed south Karnataka.
Even Gandhiji called him as raja rushi and also said that there is no need of democracy if this kind of monarch exist."
We must give lot of credit to SM Krishna for Modern Bengaluru.
Ex-CM of Karnataka S.M. Krishna worked a lot for IT investments in Bengaluru n created opportunities too. Glad to here about the Mysuru Wodeyars thank you 
"Government should actually invest heavily towards infrastructure, roads and traffic management in Bangalore. City started losing its charm"
Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV is the greatest statesman/king of the 20th century India !! We owe a lot to him.
"Previously most people (especially north Indians) said and voted that Bengaluru was an overrated city and yet they still come dozens in numbers. Be grateful, whatever your perception may be Bengaluru always welcomes you "
"Sky is the limit for Bengaluru. If only we had able leaders, Bengaluru would be known worldwide. I just hope the state govt focuses more and make it easier for businesses than it already is. Public transport has to be boosted and road conditions have to be maintained. This way 80% of Bengaluru's problems will be solved. I love this city"
"Bengaluru is not ""The Silicon Valley of India"", Bengaluru is Bengaluru of India, while Silicon valley is in America. China doesn't call Shenzen as silicon valley of China, because Shenzen is Shenzen, just like Bengaluru is Bengaluru. Comparing to something, by default would make it second, but we want it to be the first. I am from Madhya Pradesh, here Indore is also growing with light speed, many other cities in India are also, which which cities are we gonna compare and make them secondary?"
So happy to see that you started the video by mentioning the legendary Maharaja our beloved Nalvadi Prabhu. It is so sad to see that lot of Kannadigas still do not recognise how great man he was. He certainly was way ahead of his times and his rule in true sense was Ramarajya. All the policy makers and politicians must learn from our Maharaja.
"Bengaluru is not just a""CITY"", It's mini ""WORLD""
I BENGALURU , ನಮ್ಮ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು
️️️️️️️"
Kudos to all the Raja's and leaders... Most importantly the  visionary business men who had to go through the govts to achieve all this... Proud of being a Kannadiga and born in Bengaluru 
“Bangalore is a brand the world identifies India with. It is also the single biggest reason why India has become such a hot investment destination.” ~ Manmohan Singh
"Kudos to S M Krishna, you forgot to mention his name. During his tenure he puts red carpet to the IT companies   and he introduced computers labs in the govt schools."
"I like this statement :
Moral of the story is that
It is not just one leader and one visionary.
But the consistent process of ideation, execution and evolution of public policies that turned Bangalore into an iconic start up city of India .."
